					'story' => '<h4>Golestan Garden</h4>
									The main strategy of Aysan is the connection and coherence with Golestan garden which is located next to the project. The west facade is inspired by wheat form in order to adjoin the nature to bazaar.
									<h4>Modesty</h4>
									The modest formation in urban context and approach to human scale with horizontal emphasis are considered in order to get a close relation with people.
									<h4>Water, Wind, Soil and Fire</h4>
									Garden, tower, city and bazaar are remembrance of ancient concepts like water, wind, soil and fire. The gap created in the heart of the towers continues all along the towers, dividing them into two parts. Therefore the towers segregated to four which is the reminiscent of four elements in Iranian culture and tradition. The mentioned gap creates a mysterious atmosphere as if there is a precious gem sealed within the towers. The gap embraces the building core which includes all connection elements and voids. Perhaps, there is a secret in connection. Human connections that establish all the humanistic principles and are reminiscent of spectacular culture and tradition of alongside Silk Road civilizations.
									<h4>Silk Road</h4>
									Aysan twin towers have a mystery inside, creating  a living and economic environment in order to expand as an international trade center in the heart of Middle East ,alongside the Silk road. Aysan towers are reminder of collective conscious of world nations and they play a major role in unity and life enrichment. The silky texture of Aysan towers is a metaphor of this concept.
									<h4>Transparency</h4>
									5. Aysan towers ascent to sky above and emphasize on freedom concept which is in continuous involvement with transparency term.
									<h4>Freedom</h4>
									6. The bazaar body emphasizes on horizontal expansion and inclines the body to ascent in order to make the soul free which is the final target of project that is accomplished with the ascent of towers to the skies and transparency of the project.
									Aysan Multifunctional Complex.

					'story' => '<h4>Golestan Garden</h4>
									The home is considered as an inseparable concept from the ancient Iranian civilization and culture ; linked to the nature , providing freshness and liveliness to its residents. In other words home in its ancient concept is a combination of the building and garden which would place the man within. A humane space enfolding every single detail of nature such as the sweet sound of birds chirping , the melody of water drops on the surface , the touch of the trees , the golden color of the sunrays on the brick structure and the reflection of the building enfolded by the nature in the surface of a pool. 
With the change in people’s lifestyle , development of the cities and the uprising demand for constructing high-rise buildings ; this valuable heritage of our ancestors efforts in engaging the architecture with nature has gone obliterated , Which has changed into a blurred memory over less than a century. 
This project was the result of our efforts in revitalizing this lost heritage and giving a new interpretation to the old concept. Which we believe one of the main reasons of the cultural crisis our society is engaged with nowadays is the result of this abrupt shift in the living space. 
<br>
<h5>Location</h5>
the project is situated in a land with 20 meters width and 50 meters length and is located on the south of a 20 meters width street. The 30 meters length of the northern portion of the site planwas our boundaries for constructing the apartment ; splitting the connection between the southern yard and the street. With this regulation disconnecting the linkage between the yard and and the street , the challenging part was to reconnect this fracture with a solution. 
We came up with a solution to lift up the greenery from the street level to the northern façade and to the roof and then again turning into the southern façade and at last rejoining with the garden in the yard. In other words the landscape is formed by linkage between the northern and southern façade and the roof. 
<h5>Nature</h5>
A pragmatic approach to nature and sustainability
<b>First :</b> Local materials and recycled ones from the existing building before construction are used in the construction of the project. Railroad timbers and leftover bricks from the previous structure were washed , processed and used in covering the floor and walls of the yard after 40 years.
<br><b>Second :</b>  The materials used in construction of the project such as wood , bricks , iron plates and stones are considered as environment friendly materials and are acquired from local resources. 
<br><b>Third :</b> Using solar energy for supplying the power needed for lighting the common spaces. The energy is collected by the solar panels placed on the roof , saved in a battery and used in time of need. 
<br><b>Forth : </b>the double skin façade facing the street would prevent the heat exchange between indoors and outdoors. The outer shell is a wooden skin with the ability to control the natural lighting and the inner shell is a glass curtain of double-glazed windows providing the indoors with the daylight brightness and nighttime privacy in combination with the outer shell.
<br><b>Fifth : </b>As mentioned before we have focused on the idea of the integrating the landscape with the greenery covering the balconies in each floor. 
<br><b>Sixth : </b>With having the water issue of Tehran in our minds we have added a water harvesting system to the project to collect the rainwater from the roof ; to be used for irrigation after filtration.

					<h5>Function</h5>
						This project was designed in 8 floors. Each floor has separate functions such as: Aerobic, bodybuilding, clinic for medical treatment, swimming pool, solar sauna, hydrotraphy, steam sauna, dried sauna, café, restaurant, locker room.

					<h5>Form</h5>
						we designed two facades, one exterior façade (morph façade) which was inspired by sport activities. The destination between mesh façade (exterior) and transparent façade (second façade) is 120 Cm and stair case located between 2 facades which could show the movement of people and we can see shadow of them.

					'details' => '<p>Architect / Sara Kalantary and Reza Sayadian</p>
								 <p>Client / Mrs. Nazila Ansari</p>',
					'story' => '<h4>Story</h4>
					<br><h2>Context</h2><br>
						<p>Danial apartment is located in North east district of Tehran. The neighborhood that Danial is constructed, used to be summer houses and gardens and as Tehran expanded, the gardens were destroyed and trees where replaced by buildings.  SO We decided to put back nature, being bold and remind people of lost nature.</p><br>
						<p>While we were exploring the site for the first time,we saw an frothy years old pine tree left from a beautiful jungle which used to exist there not very time ago.That tree was the inspirational idea that come across.Tha’s why Danial carries the memory of the lost trees of Tehran. </p><br>
						<h5>Concept</h5>
						<p>The design is based on four ideas:</p>
						<ul class="ul-list">
							<br><li>Primitive shelter</li></br>
							<p>First we attempted to approach to the idea of primitive shelter. back in time, when there was nothing except sun and human being and only trees could provide a sanctuary for resting with providing pleasant shadow. </p>
							<p>This primitive idea led us to design an abstract concept inspired by trees’ branches and leaves form which can be seen in nature.</p>
							<br><li>Movement</li><br>
							<p>In nature when the wind blows, leaves and branches will sway.After coming up with the main concept we noticed it would be unique if we could apply the movement of leaves and branches as they sway in the wind in our design.</p>
							<br><li>Transparency</li><br>
							<p>This design is based on light and shadow play of sunlight by implementing three layers of transparency : <br>
								a) Solid like, trunk  (body) and thicker branches of tree <br>
								b) Translucent : A when leaves just give us a mysterious picture of what is behind.<br>
								c) Transparent : The way sun rays escape the leaves and nourish our souls through wholes<br>
								 These different transparency grades would provide the capability to make sunlight controllable.<br>
							</p>
							<br><li>Orosi</li><br>
							<P>Orosi which is a window used by our ancestors to provide privacy, it has a deep root in persian architecture back ground.</p>
						</ul>
						<br><h2>Design</h2><br>
						<h5>Strategy</h5><br>
						<p>A)	Creating a dynamic façade was the main strategy in the design process. The façade which could morph through movement and sun rays as do trees. </p>
						<p>B)	We also enabled the residents to be the director of their desired façade and give them the opportunity to appear and disappear as thought being filmed. </p>
						<p>C)	Creating a borderless space uniting the outside with inside.</p>
						<br><h5>Technique</h5><br>
						<p>The whole exterior facade is consisting of 20 tree-like panels. Each floor’s façade is covered by 4 of the panels which complete each other two by two, all installed on two  rails which can be moved manually all along the rails horizontally, providing infinite choices to the resident who can control the panels from inside.
						The variety in shapes of facade added by sunlight angels have an unique effect on the interior. since by every inch of movement we have a new lighting and shadow dancing .
						We used the idea of shadow to design the ceiling and walls as you can see in the picture. 
						The second layer of façade is covered by large windows, permitting a close connection to the city.
						</p>
						<br><h5>Plan</h5><br>
						<p>Danial is set on 320 square meter rectangular shaped land 
						The plan was constructing a 7 –story building covering 1344 sqm, including 5 residential apartment in 5 volumes , each volume covers 165 sqm. Parking and main entrance are located on Ground floor and recreation facilities ( indoor pool , sauna and Jacuzzi ) are set in the basement

								'story' => '<h4>Story</h4>
								<h5>Function</h5>
									<p>This building was a turning point in the history of our company. It was where all of our activities during the past decade has came to a sweet result…</p><br>
									<p>Danial reminded us that if we dig down something we can find the balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section. It taught us that opposing forces interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than each part. Everything has both yin and yang aspects, (for instance shadow cannot exist without light). Architects always wonder how they could creat a deep space in a flat façade.The answer is  exactly the same as what happens in matt. It’s the story of zero and infinity!</p><br>
									<p>You can only get close to infinity when you are in the zero point. Here the infinity is a full open mountain view form  the Danial window, the deep view of the mountain peak high above south of Tehran which marches away in all directions.</p><br>
									<p>While we were exploring the site for the first time, we saw an isolated pine tree left from a beautiful jungle which used to exist  there not very long time ago…</p><br>
									<p>After searching the area closely, we discovered a small pine tree garden which we enjoyed marveling at it all the time we were building Danial.
									That tree was the inspirational idea that came across. That&#0027s why Danial carries the memory of the lost trees of Tehran.
									Trees are absolutely vital to human; they provide shelter, shade and clean air , they offer people safety and security. 
									A tree has many branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. Below the ground, the roots branches spread out widely and above the ground, the branches divide into shoots that bear leaves. These three parts (the trunk, roots and leaves)  have different textures with different transparencies), this is where the idea of the facade design came from.
									</p><br>
									<p>There is nothing more beautiful than a fully grown tree, a tree with fall foliage, trees inspire us to relax and commune with nature, taking advantage of the shade, the quiet goings-on of the tree&#0027s inhabitants and its beauty.</p></br>
									<p>Kengo Kuma says every gentle blow of wind is enough to fly it, as well as every ray of light can easily cross it to make it gleam.</p></br>
									<p>it is always in a positive way, commenting on the beauty of the site, the light, or the way the wind affects the movement of the Tay.</p></br>
